**Developer note**

*This is a fun project that I made I know that the application size too large, I know it minimizes on ctrl+D or any similar command, limited by my time and tech knowledge I could not achieve the intent of making a widget using ElectronJS. If you can solve the above issues feel free to [contact me](mailto:your-dhanushhs51@gmail.com)*.
